# Documentation Archive

This folder contains **historical / superseded** documentation that we keep for reference but **do not maintain** day-to-day.

## Why this exists
- Reduce confusion from outdated plans/status docs that no longer match the codebase.
- Keep context and decision history without cluttering the “current” documentation paths.

## Policy
- If a doc is **superseded** (new canonical doc exists) or is a **snapshot** (e.g., roadmap/test plan at a point in time), move it under `docs/archive/`.
- Prefer keeping **current** docs short and linking to archived “deep dives” only when needed.
- When archiving a doc that is already linked from other places, leave a **small stub** at the old path that points to the archived location (to avoid breaking links).

## Structure
- `docs/archive/backend/` — backend historical docs
- `docs/archive/frontend/` — frontend historical docs
- `docs/archive/plans/` — reorganizations, proposals, one-off plans
