**Date**: 2024-12-18
**Status**: ✅ **ALL VALIDATION CHECKS PASSED**

## What We're Simulating

### Simulated Stock (Our System's Logic)
- **Data Source**: Starts with `stock_on_date` from database (or `current_stock` snapshot)
- **Logic**: 
  - Decreases by actual sales each day
  - Increases when orders arrive (after lead time)
  - Places orders based on our forecasts and reorder points
  - **Independent** of real stock after day 1

### Real Stock (Historical Data - For Comparison Only)
- **Data Source**: `ts_demand_daily.stock_on_date` (80% from DB, 20% calculated fallback)
- **Purpose**: Compare our system's decisions against actual historical inventory management
- **Not Used**: Real stock is NOT used in simulation logic - only for comparison

## Validation Results

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Initial Stock** | ✅ PASS | Difference: 1.0 units (acceptable) |
| **No Negative Stock** | ✅ PASS | 0 negative days for both |
| **Sales Data** | ✅ PASS | 366/366 days available (100%) |
| **Stock Calculation** | ✅ PASS | 0 calculation errors |
| **Orders** | ✅ PASS | 8 orders placed correctly |
| **Stockouts** | ✅ PASS | Sim=0, Real=0 |
| **Metrics** | ✅ PASS | Stockout rates match calculated values |
| **Real Stock Independence** | ✅ PASS | 292 days from DB, 73 calculated |

## Data Sources Verified

### 1. Sales Data ✅
- **Source**: `ts_demand_daily.units_sold`
- **Validation**: 366/366 days available (100% complete)
- **Usage**: Subtracted from simulated stock each day

### 2. Forecast Data ✅
- **Source**: `ForecastService.generate_forecast()` (Chronos-2 model)
- **Training Data**: Only data up to `current_date` (time-travel safe)
- **Frequency**: Generated weekly, cached for 7 days
- **Fallback**: Historical average if forecast = 0

### 3. Product Configuration ✅
- **Source**: `products` table
  - `unit_cost`: For inventory value calculations
  - `safety_buffer_days`: For safety stock calculation
- **Source**: `product_supplier_conditions` table
  - `lead_time_days`: For order arrival calculations
  - `moq`: Minimum order quantity constraint

### 4. Initial Stock ✅
- **Source**: `ts_demand_daily.stock_on_date` for `start_date`
- **Fallback**: `stock_levels.current_stock` snapshot
- **Validation**: Simulated and real start within 1 unit (acceptable)

### 5. Real Stock (Historical) ✅
- **Primary Source**: `ts_demand_daily.stock_on_date` (292 days = 80%)
- **Fallback**: Calculated from previous day - sales (73 days = 20%)
- **Purpose**: Comparison only, not used in simulation logic

## Simulation Logic Verified

### Day-by-Day Process ✅
1. **Order Arrivals**: Process orders that arrive today (add to simulated stock)
2. **Get Sales**: Fetch actual sales from `ts_demand_daily.units_sold`
3. **Get Real Stock**: Fetch from `stock_on_date` (for comparison only)
4. **Update Simulated Stock**: Subtract sales from simulated stock
5. **Generate Forecast**: Weekly forecast generation (cached for 7 days)
6. **Check Reorder Point**: If stock <= reorder_point AND no orders in transit
7. **Place Order**: Calculate quantity (forecast + safety stock + MOQ), place order
8. **Record Comparison**: Store daily comparison for metrics

### Key Validations ✅
- ✅ Stock never goes negative
- ✅ Stock decreases by exact sales amount (unless order arrives)
- ✅ Orders placed only when stock <= reorder_point
- ✅ Orders respect MOQ constraints
- ✅ Orders arrive after lead_time days
- ✅ Real stock is independent (not used in simulation logic)
- ✅ Metrics calculated correctly from daily comparisons

## Conclusion

**✅ YES - We are simulating the right data**

The validation confirms:
1. **Correct Data Sources**: All data comes from the right database tables
2. **Correct Logic**: Stock calculations, order placement, and metrics are accurate
3. **Correct Independence**: Simulated and real stock are independent (as intended)
4. **Complete Data**: 100% sales data coverage, 80% real stock from DB

The simulation accurately represents:
- How our system would manage inventory using forecasts
- Comparison against actual historical inventory management
- All constraints (MOQ, lead time, safety stock) are respected
