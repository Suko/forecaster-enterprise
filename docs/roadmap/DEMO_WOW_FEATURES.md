# Demo “Wow” Features

This is a short list of high-impact UI/UX improvements that make demos feel “alive” and make value obvious quickly.

## Highest impact

- **SKU detail drilldown** (history + forecast + “why”): see `docs/features/INVENTORY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- **Dashboard trends** (real data + period selector): see `docs/features/DASHBOARD_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- **Order suggestions inside Cart** (one-click PO creation): see `docs/features/PURCHASE_ORDER_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- **Forecast freshness + “using_forecast” indicator** (trust + transparency): see `docs/system/BACKEND_FRONTEND_COMPATIBILITY.md`

## Nice to have

- **Shareable demo scenarios** (saved filters, saved views)
- **“Explain this” tooltips** for DIR / stockout risk / reorder logic
- **Export-ready reports** (CSV/Excel) with consistent columns
