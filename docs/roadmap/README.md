# Roadmap (vNext)

This folder contains **planned work** and **future improvements**.

**Important:** Anything in `docs/roadmap/` is **not a v1 contract** and may not match the current codebase.

## Rules

- Every document must state:
  - **Status:** `proposed` | `accepted` | `in-progress` | `done` | `rejected`
  - **Target:** a version like `v1.1`, `v2.0`, or a date window
- If a roadmap doc describes an API shape, it must link to:
  - `docs/backend/API_REFERENCE.md` (generated), and/or
  - `docs/system/CONTRACTS.md` (contracts), and/or
  - the specific backend route/schema file(s) it intends to change.

## Where things go

- Feature plans: `docs/roadmap/features/`
- Product planning: `docs/roadmap/product/`
- Backend roadmap and technical epics: `docs/roadmap/backend/`
